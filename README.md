This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf. You will then be allowed to reuse the function in your future projects. You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

Description Write a library that contains ft_printf, a function
that will mimic the real printf

•The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);

•You have to recode the libc’s printf function

•It must not do the buffer management like the real printf

•It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

•It will be compared with the real printf

•You must use the command ar to create your librairy, using the command libtool
is forbidden.

•%c print a single character.

•%s print a string of characters.

•%p The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.

•%d print a decimal (base 10) number.

•%i print an integer in base 10.

•%u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.

•%x print a number in hexadecimal (base 16).

•%% print a percent sign
